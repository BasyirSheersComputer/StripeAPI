Stripe API Integration
This project integrates with the Stripe API to manage payments, subscriptions, and customer billing in a secure and efficient manner. It is designed for developers to quickly implement Stripe functionalities in their applications.

Features

Customer Management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete customer data.
Subscription Services: Manage subscription plans and billing cycles.
Webhook Support: Listen and respond to Stripe events in real-time.

Prerequisites
Stripe Account with API keys configured.
Stripe CLI (optional, for testing webhooks).
.NET SDK (if applicable).
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/StripeAPIIntegration.git
cd StripeAPIIntegration
2. Install Dependencies
For .NET Projects:
bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
For Node.js Projects:
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Configure API Keys
Store your Stripe Secret Key securely using environment variables or secret managers. Never hardcode API keys into your source code.

Example:
Environment Variables:

bash
Copy code
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
Using appsettings.json (Development Only):

json
Copy code
{
  "Stripe": {
    "SecretKey": "your_stripe_secret_key",
    "PublishableKey": "your_stripe_publishable_key"
  }
}
Usage

For .NET Projects:
bash
Copy code
dotnet run
For Node.js Projects:
bash
Copy code
npm start
2. Available Endpoints
POST /api/payments: Process a payment.
POST /api/customers: Create a new customer.
GET /api/subscriptions: Retrieve subscription details.
POST /api/webhooks: Handle Stripe webhook events.
3. Webhook Configuration

stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks
Update your webhook URL in the Stripe Dashboard.

Best Practices
Secure API Keys: Use environment variables or a secret management tool like Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

Enable Webhook Signing: Validate webhook events by verifying their signatures.

Handle Errors Gracefully: Ensure robust error handling for API responses.

Testing
Use Stripe's test keys and test card numbers for development.
Simulate webhooks using the Stripe CLI:
bash
Copy code
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
